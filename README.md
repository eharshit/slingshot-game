## Slingshot Game

A tiny Pygame slingshot experiment. I tweaked it with a rocket icon, colored engine flames, and a simple speed meter.

### Preview

### Theme
- **Gravity well**: the planet pulls the rocket; closer paths curve more.
- **Slingshot**: approach on a curved trajectory to gain speed and change direction.
- **Energy**: launch power + gravitational assist determine final velocity.
- **Goal**: experiment with angles and power to perform smooth flybys without crashing.

- **Start**: `python main.py`

### Controls
